### Key Points:
1. **Code Snippets**: The Git commands are enclosed within a separate code block under the **Installation** section.
2. **Distinct Sections**: Each section is clearly defined, making it easy to navigate the document.
3. **No Overlap**: The command snippet should not bleed into other sections, ensuring clarity.

Make sure you copy the entire structure correctly, especially the triple backticks to denote code blocks, so that they are treated as separate sections in Markdown. This will help maintain the organization of your README. Let me know if you need any more help!
